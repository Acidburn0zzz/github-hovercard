Quick user hovercard for GitHub.

## Installation

[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-hovercard/mmoahbbnojgkclgceahhakhnccimnplk)

[Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/github-hovercard/)

## Known issues

For unauthenticated requests, GitHub API has a fairly low request limit.

In later versions I might introduce access tokens to increase this limit.

Working on it.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks [Tooltipster](http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/) for the awesome tooltip component and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) for basic operations.
